This understanding is achieved by using qualitative and quantitative methods such as interviews, surveys, and other methods.  User research is best when it’s conducted quickly and limits the scope of testing to a specific task, or a single portion of a larger process.  ",

This approach shows respect and an appreciation for the hard work it took to get your digital property to this point.",
