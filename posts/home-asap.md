## Project Brief
Design a web application to provide real estate agents a personalized web application where they can drive their clients to see current
home listings, their recent activity, an opportunity to learn more about the agent, and provide rich interesting data about the property listings.

---

## My approach to this project
- Define the Information Architecture (IA)
- Design Logo
- Design wireframes of the pages and workflows based on IA
- Design review with the stakeholders
- Design an interactive prototype from wireframes
- Deliver to the development team fully designed pages in an interactive prototype in Invision.
